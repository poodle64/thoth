## VARCON / English Speller Database (US→AU spelling data)

The Australian-spelling normalisation feature is built from the VARCON variant
data (part of the English Speller Database / SCOWL), the same dataset that
generates the en_AU Hunspell dictionary used by major browsers and office
suites. The data is vendored at `src-tauri/data/varcon/varcon.txt` and compiled
into `src-tauri/src/transcription/au_spelling_map.rs` by
`src-tauri/scripts/generate_au_spelling.py`.

Source: <https://github.com/en-wl/wordlist> (VarCon 2020.12.07).
