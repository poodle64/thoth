//! Regression tests for the MCP `transcription` tool — issue #82.
//!
//! The `list` action once returned `[]` despite thousands of records. These
//! tests drive the real database-backed functions the MCP actions call:
//!
//!   • `list`  → `database::list_transcriptions(...)`  (primary assertion; this
//!               is the function `mcp_server/mod.rs` calls for the `list` action)
//!   • `stats` → `database::transcription::get_transcription_stats_cmd()`
//!   • cross-path: `export::search_history(...)` must agree with the above
//!
//! and assert that `list` returns seeded records and that all three counts
//! agree (the consistency the issue asked us to guard).
//!
//! The whole database layer talks to a process-global connection path, so the
//! suite runs in its own integration-test binary and points `THOTH_DATA_DIR`
//! at a throwaway directory. All assertions live in one test so the single
//! process-global path is set exactly once.
