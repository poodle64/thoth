//! FluidAudio transcription using Apple Neural Engine via CoreML
//!
//! Runs Parakeet TDT models on the Apple Neural Engine (ANE) for
//! dramatically faster transcription (~210x real-time factor).
//!
//! Requires the `fluidaudio` Cargo feature and macOS with Apple Silicon.
//!
//! # NOTE — empirically load-bearing constants and invariants
//!
//! The segmentation constants (`SINGLE_SHOT_MAX_SECS`, `SEGMENT_TARGET_SECS`,
//! pad lengths) and the no-normalisation invariant in `write_padded_wav` are
//! empirically tuned to work around a non-monotonic failure mode in FluidAudio
//! 0.15's chunked decoder: depending on recording length the decoder either
//! drops the tail or appends a hallucinated filler token. Padding-only tuning
//! merely moves which lengths fail. Any change to this decode path MUST be
//! verified via a LIVE APP recording at 19 s, 52 s, 144 s, and ~5 min.
//! Unit tests and the fork's standalone CLI example do NOT exercise the full
//! decode path (they skip the app's pad + WAV-write step).
